# 💖 Thanks for your interest in contributing to **pridecat**!

## 🏳️‍🌈 I want to add a new flag!

Awesome! I ask that you follow these guidelines:

* Please get the color hex codes from an official-ish source. Most of our flags are currently sourcing their colors from Wikipedia, but some are sourced from the original designer.
* Please leave a comment alongside the flag's entry in the table, citing your source.
* Please credit the flag's designer if possible, following the wording style of the existing flags.
* If it's a 3-color flag, please double it up so the table has 6 color values. See the pansexual flag for reference.
* If appropriate, add aliases to the `aliases` map - for example, "ace" as an alias for "asexual".
* Don't forget to also add the flag to the README, and please make sure the list remains in alphabetical order. You don't need to worry about the `--help` text, as that's generated automatically at runtime.

## 🐞 I want to fix a bug!

That's great! Your patch is welcomed.

* If there's not already an open Issue for it, please add one detailing the nature of the bug.
* Make sure to mention the Issue number in the Pull Request message.

## 💡 I want to add a new feature!

I'm not looking to expand the scope of the project too much, so please consider the following:

* If it can be emulated with existing commands (for example: collapsing consecutive empty lines can be performed using `cat -s`), then it's not really within the scope of this project.
* Otherwise, if it's something that makes sense _specifically_ for **pridecat**, please open an Issue for it, and let's discuss it before you start sending patches in.
